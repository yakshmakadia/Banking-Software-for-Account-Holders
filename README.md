# Basic Banking Software for Account Holders

## Project Objective
This project aims to develop simple banking software that allows customers to perform basic banking operations remotely.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure login using an ID and password.
- **Balance Check**: Users can check their current account balance.
- **Deposit Money**: Users can deposit funds into their accounts after re-entering their password.
- **Withdraw Money**: Users can withdraw funds from their accounts securely.
- **Exit Option**: Users can exit the application safely.

## Methodology
1. The system maintains a database of users with their respective passwords and account balances.
2. Users are prompted to enter their ID and password to access the banking operations.
3. After authentication, users can check their balance, deposit funds, or withdraw money.
4. If the credentials are incorrect, the system denies access.
5. The program runs in a loop, allowing multiple transactions until the user chooses to exit.
